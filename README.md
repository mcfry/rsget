An electron-react app for filtering live information from the RS economy. I used it frequently to 'play' the RS GE in the background while I programmed other projects.

Uses Electron, React, Redux, Flow, MaterialUI, Sass, and Webpack.

If I ever find time, I will clean up the code. Maybe modernize this a bit as the project still works and works well.
